  <td><p id = "under">General Terms</p>
 <p><span>
ATEMI WAZA Striking techniques that are normally used in conjunction with grappling and throwing techniques.</br>
BOGYO ROKU KYODO Six Defense Actions. A basic drill of the Japan Karate-Do Ryobu-Kai. Uses the old names of techniqes such as AGE TE, </br> 
HARAI TE (or GEDAN BARAI), SOTO YOKO TE, UCHI YOKO TE, SHUTO TE, and SUKUI TE. BUDO Martial way.</br>
The Japanese character for "BU" (martial) is derived from characters meaning "stop" and (a weapon like a) "halberd." In conjunction, </br>
 then, "BU" may have the connotation "to stop the halberd." In Karate, there is an assumption that the best way to prevent violent conflict is </br>
 to emphasize the cultivation of individual character. The way (DO) of Karate is thus equivalent to the way of BU, taken in this sense of preventing </br>
 or avoiding violence so far as possible. </br>
CHUDAN Mid-section. During the practice of KIHON IPPON KUMITE (one step basic sparring), the attacker will normally announce where he/she will </br>
attack JODAN, CHUDAN, or GEDAN (Upper level, Mid-level, or lower level). COUNTING TO 10 IN JAPANESE 1.Ichi 2.Ni 3.San 4.Shi 5.Go 6.Roku 7.Shichi 8.Hachi </br>

DANI (Dan)Level, Rank or Degree. Black Belt rank. Ranks under Black Belt are called KYU ranks. </br>

attaining enlightenment or a way of improving one's character through traditional training.</br>
DOJO Literally "place of the Way." Also "place of enlightenment." The place where we practice Karate. Traditional etiquette prescribes bowing in the direction of </br>
the designated front of the dojo (SHOMEN) whenever entering or leaving the dojo.</br>
DOMO ARIGATO GOZAIMASHITA Japanese for "thank you very much." At the end of each class, it is proper to bow and thank the instructor and those with whom you've trained.</br>

patches and markings. GO NO SEN The tactic where one allows the opponent to attack first so to open up targets for counter acttack.

KAMAE may also connote proper distance (Ma-ai) with respect to one's partner. Although "KAMAE" generally refers to a physical stance, there is an important </br>
parallel in Karate between one's physical and one's psychological bearing. Adopting a strong physical stance helps to promote the correlative adoption of a </br>
strong psychological attitude. It is important to try so far as possible to maintain a positive and strong mental bearing in Karate. </br>
